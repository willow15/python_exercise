- email:
  Include downloading email attachments, sending email(normal files and zipped files).  
  About sending zipped files: no idea why the attachment I received is a binary file which does not end with ".zip" no matter how I tried, but when I changed the name of file I downloaded to 'something.zip', it worked!! It's a zipped file now.
